rCrossings readme v 0.0.1

   This is filler text and should not be read by anyone. Seriously.
   You'd think that it would explain that you must install ruby-sdl in some way, be it through your package manager, Windows installer, or a gem, before trying to develop something with rCrossongs.
   You'd also think that we would not notice the typo on the last line of the preceding paragraph - "rCrossongs", but it would mean that we did not anticipate that our little game shall have a musical-rythm-based derivative that will become the next wave's Guitarr Hero, only cooler.
   If you got our cue, yes, the last one will be a game. About pirates. Who play guitars. And are somewhat heroic. That's about it.
   I tell you, rCrossings will take the world by storm. An if it doesn't, its spunky children will.
   Peace in.
